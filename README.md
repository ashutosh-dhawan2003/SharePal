# SharePal File Sharing Application

**SharePal** is a Python-based desktop application designed for seamless file sharing over a local network. It features a simple graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to select and transfer files between devices using socket programming.

## Features

- **File Sharing**: Send and receive files over a local network using sockets.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using Tkinter for a smooth and intuitive experience.
- **File Selection**: Browse and select files from your local machine for sharing.
- **Local Network Communication**: Share files within the same network using a client-server architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Tkinter**: A built-in Python library used to design the graphical user interface.
- **Socket Programming**: Implements network communication for file sharing.
- **FileDialog (from Tkinter)**: Allows users to browse their system to select files.
- **OS Module**: Manages file paths and handles file operations.

## Requirements

To run the SharePal application, you need the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

Note: Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashutosh-dhawan2003/sharepal-file-sharing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sharepal-file-sharing
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python sharepal.py
   ```

4. The SharePal window will open, allowing you to choose to either **Send** or **Receive** files.

## Usage

### Sending Files:

1. Click on the **Send** button in the main window.
2. In the new window, click **Select File** to browse and select the file you want to share.
3. The file will be sent to the receiving device over the local network.

### Receiving Files:

1. Click on the **Receive** button in the main window.
2. SharePal will wait for incoming connections from a sender within the same network.
3. The file will be transferred and saved in the designated folder.

### Example Interaction:

- **User (Sender)**: Selects a file and waits for the receiver to connect.
- **User (Receiver)**: Receives the file and the transfer completes with a success message.

## Customization

You can extend SharePal to add new functionalities such as:
- Supporting multiple file transfers at once.
- Adding encryption to secure the file transfers.
- Displaying file transfer progress or status indicators.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that both the sender and receiver are on the same local network.
- If the connection fails, check if the firewall or antivirus software is blocking the communication.
